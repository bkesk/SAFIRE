    Workflow tests based on Diamond
    
    Attributes:
    - `test_files` : a dictionary for holding the 
                       the path where temporary 
                       test files are located. The
                       intention is to allow writing
                       and reading to occur in separate 
                       tests.

    Currently only tests that everythings runs without errors,
      we want to varify that we read the same stuff that we tried 
      to write.
