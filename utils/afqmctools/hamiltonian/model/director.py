class HamiltonianDirector(_HamiltonianDirector):
    r"""Directs building a model Hamiltonian based on a source input file or dict. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : str | dict
        a description of the Hamiltonian (and possibly lattice) parameters.
        See Notes for details on Hamiltonian parameter syntax and conventions.
        If a str is given, it is interpreted as the name of an input file in .toml
        format and parameters are read from that file.
        If a dict is given, then parameters are read directly from the dict.
    lattice : afqmctools.systems.lattice.Lattice, optional
        the Lattice instance which describes the geometry of the lattice. 
        If not specified, the lattice will be built from the source input.
    builder : afqmctools.hamiltonian.model.builder.HamiltonianBuilder, optional
        the builder that will be directed by HamiltonianDirector. If not
        specified, a default HamiltonianBuilder will be used (this is what
        almost all users will want).
        

    Methods
    -------
    build()
        builds and returns a Hamilton instance based on the build steps
        defined in the source input.
    release_builder()
        releases the HamiltonianBuilder instance to the caller. This disables
        the build() method until a HamiltonianBuilder is bound to the director.
        A HamiltonianBuilder can be bound to the director using the bind_builder()
        method.
    bind_builder(builder:HamiltonianBuilder,force=False)
        binds a HamiltonianBuilder to the director. If force is True, then the
        current HamiltonianBuilder is replaced with the new builder. If force is
        False, then an error is raised if a HamiltonianBuilder is already bound to
        the director.

    
    Notes
    -----
    The Hamiltonian is built by a sequence of build steps which are specified
    in the source input. Build steps are specified as key-value pairs in the 
    'hamiltonian' section of the input file or in the source dict.
    By default, nearest-neighbor hopping is included in the Hamiltonian; but
    all interaction terms must be explicitly included in the input.

    The following build steps are supported, and are listed as `key : description`.
    Also see the `HamiltonianBuilder` class for more details on the build steps,
    and for finer control over Hamiltonian construction. The acceptable input dimensions
    are also listed for each build step; other input dimensions will raise an error.
    
    - t : nth-order neighbor hopping term; input convention are as follows:
      
      - if t is a scalar, then nerest-neighbor hopping is included with strength t
      - if t is a 1-dimensional list (i.e. [t1,t2,...,tn]), then up to nth-order hopping is included
      - if t is a 2-dimensional with shape (nbands, nbands), then
        the t is interpreted as an on-site inter-band hopping matrix
      - if t is a list of 2-dimensional arrays, then each element is interpreted as an on-site 
        inter-band hopping matrix. This is functionally the same as :math:`t_{mn} = \sum t^{(i)}_{mn}`
        where :math:`t^{(i)}` is the ith element of the list and :math:`m,n` are band indices.

    - U : onsite Hubbard interaction term; input convention are as follows:
      
      - if U is a scalar, then the onsite Hubbard interaction term is included with strength U
        and applied to all sites and bands.
      - if U is 1-dimensional with length nbands (i.e. [U1,U2,...,Um] where for an m-band model),
        then the onsite Hubbard interaction term is included with strength U_i applied to band i
        and uniformaly across sites.
      - if U is 1-dimensional with length nsites (i.e. [U1,U2,...,Un] where n is the number of sites), 
        then the onsite Hubbard interaction term is included with strength U_i applied to site i
        and uniformly across bands.

    - U1 : Hubbard density-density interaction term. Input convention are as follows:
      
      - if U1 is a scalar, then the Hubbard density-density interaction term is included with strength U1
        and is applied to all sites, and is unfirom across bands.
      - if U1 is a 2-dimensional with shape (nbands, nbands), then U1 is used as an intrasite density-density 
        interaction, and is applied uniformly accross sites.

    - U2 : Hubbard spin-spin interaction term. Input convention are as follows:
      
      - if U2 is a scalar, then the Hubbard spin-spin interaction term is included with strength U2
        and is applied to all sites, and is unfirom across bands.
      - if U2 is a 2-dimensional with shape (nbands, nbands), then U2 is used as an intrasite spin-spin
        interaction, and is applied uniformly accross sites.

    - J : Hund's coupling interaction term. Input convention are as follows:
      
      - if J is a scalar, then the Hund's coupling interaction term is included with strength J
        and is applied to all sites, and is unfirom across bands.
      - if J is a 2-dimensional with shape (nbands, nbands), then J is used as an intrasite 
        Hund's coupling interaction, and is applied uniformly accross sites.
