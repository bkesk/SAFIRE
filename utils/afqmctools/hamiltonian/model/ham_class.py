class Hamiltonian:
    """
    A container for Hamiltonian terms. Terms are stored
    by the naming conventions used in the afqmc code.
        
    An *example* of the internal structure is as follows::

        terms = {
            'tij' : [tij_csr_1,tij_csr_2,...],
            'Ui' : [U_csr],
            'U1ij' : [U1ij_csr],
            'U2ij' : [U2ij_csr],
            'Jij' : [Jij_csr_1,Jij_csr_2]
        }

    A dictionary with keys corresponding to the standard
    generalized Hamiltonian term names stores a *list*
    of terms of the same type. The list of terms can be
    collapsed into a single term if desired; however,
    keeping terms separate provides more flexibility,
    especially regarding the Hubbard-Stratonivich
    transformation. Each entry in the list should be
    a `scipy.sparse.csr_array` instance.

    By deafult, assigning terms to the Hamiltonian
    will append an additional term to the relevant list.
    
    Design notes for Developers:

    - should serve only as a container for Hamiltonian terms 
        which are built via the Director-Builder pattern.
    - this class should not directly reference the underyling lattice.
