Current Features
================

SAFIRE is formulated in the language of second quantization in terms of the generic
interacting fermionic Hamiltonian. 
The code is written as generically as possible to reflect the inherent flexibility 
of the AFQMC method.
SAFIRE's features can be categorized into either generic AFQMC implementation features, 
or concrete implementations of Hamiltonians, trial wavefunctions, walkers, and observables.
We begin with a list of the generic AFQMC implementation features.
Next, we list the concrete implementations of each type of object.
We conclude by listing which :ref:`combinations of these components and features are currently compatible <supported-combinations>` with each other.

Concrete Implementations of Hamiltonians, Wavefunctions, Walkers, and Observables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAFIRE supports multiple Hamiltonian types, wavefunction formats, walker types, and observables.
The specific **combinations** of these components that are supported depend on the computational 
architecture (CPU vs GPU).
Below, we provide a comprehensive list of supported combinations and features.

Supported Hamiltonian Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SAFIRE supports the following Hamiltonian formats.

**Dense Cholesky Hamiltonian**
   Molecular and solid systems with Cholesky decomposed two-body integrals.
**K-Point Factorized Hamiltonian** 
   For periodic solid systems exploiting k-point symmetry.
   Can directly read Hamiltonian files from CoQuí in this format.
**Lattice Model Hamiltonian**
   For lattice models (Hubbard, t-J, extended Hubbard, etc.).
   Currently **CPU only**
**Tensor Hypercontraction (THC) Hamiltonian**
   For systems using THC factorization of the electron repulsion integrals.
   Provides memory-efficient representation for large systems.
   Can directly read Hamiltonian files from CoQuí in this format.

See :ref:`Hamiltonian File Formats <Hamiltonian-classes>` for format details.

Supported Wavefunction Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**NOMSD (Non-Orthogonal Multi-Slater Determinant)**
   Single and multi-determinant trial wavefunctions represented 
   in terms of explicit Slater matrices.
   Compatible with all Hamiltonian types and acceleration modes.
**PHMSD (Particle-Hole Multi-Slater Determinant)**
   Single and (typically) multi-determinant trial wavefunctions built from 
   occupation strings ( i.e. explicit lists of occupied orbital indices ).
   Fast Woodbury updates implemented for some Hamiltonians / computational architectures (See below).

See :ref:`Wavefunction File Formats <Wavefunction-classes>` for format specifications.

Supported Walker Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**CLOSED (RHF/Closed Shell)**
   For closed-shell systems where all electrons are paired.
   Uses the same Slater matrix for both the up and down spin sectors.
   System must have an even number of electrons with :math:`N^\uparrow = N^\downarrow`.
**COLLINEAR (UHF/Open Shell)**
   For open-shell systems with collinear (up/down) spins.
   Uses separate :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` Slater determinants per walker.
**NONCOLLINEAR (GHF/Noncollinear)**
   For systems with noncollinear spin arrangements.
   Uses a single Slater matrix represented in an explicit spin-orbital basis.
   Essential for systems with spin-orbit coupling or frustrated magnetism.
**FULLYPOLARIZED**
   For fully spin-polarized systems - i.e. for :math:`N^\downarrow = 0`.

See :ref:`Random Walker Classes <Walker-classes>` for details.

Supported Estimators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Mixed Estimators**
   Ground state expectation values using mixed estimation.
   Provides approximate but efficient observable calculations.
   Only suitable for observables that commute with the interacting Hamiltonian.

**Back-Propagation Estimators**
   Pure ground state estimators via back-propagation technique.
   Multiple back-propagation lengths supported for convergence testing.
   Higher computational cost but improved accuracy for ground state properties.

For detailed information on configuring estimators, see :ref:`Estimators reference <estimators>` 
and :ref:`Observables reference <observables>`.

Supported Observables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SAFIRE supports a comprehensive set of physical observables for quantum many-body systems:

**Full 1-RDM**
   Complete one-body reduced density matrix (all walker types)
**Two-body RDM**
   Full two-body reduced density matrix (CLOSED/COLLINEAR only)
**Diagonal Two-body RDM**
   Diagonal elements of 2-RDM (all walker types)
**Spin-Spin Correlation**
   Magnetic correlation functions (all walker types)
**Pair Correlation Functions**
   Superconducting pair correlators - recommended for lattice models only (COLLINEAR/NONCOLLINEAR only)

For detailed mathematical definitions, input specifications, and compatibility matrices, 
see :ref:`Observables reference <observables>`.
