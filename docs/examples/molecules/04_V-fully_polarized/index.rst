Vanadium Atom (Fully Polarized)
===============================

This example demonstrates a fully polarized AFQMC calculation on an isolated vanadium atom
which has a ground state with :math:`S=3/2` (quartet state).
We will use the frozen core approximation to freeze all electrons except for the :math:`3d^3` valence electrons.
In the cc-pVDZ basis set, this results in 32 active orbitals and 3 active electrons.
We will use CASCI to compute the exact energy within the active space as a reference for comparison with AFQMC.

Running the Example
-------------------

The workflow follows three steps:

1. **Generate an orbital basis**: Execute ``scf/scf.py`` to perform ROHF on the vanadium atom which we will use as a basis,
   and to generate a trial wavefunction for AFQMC.
   We also run a CASCI(32o,3e) calculation to provide a reference energy.
   
   The ROHF energy should be around -942.873080272797 Ha, and the CASCI(32o,3e) energy should be 
   around -942.901099297148 Ha where the contribution in the active space is -3.53263111527235 Ha.

2. **Create AFQMC inputs**: Execute ``input/setup.py`` to generate the SAFIRE inputs.
   Note that script uses an active space for AFQMC of `cas_afqmc = (3,32)`. 
   This treats the system as having all electrons in the spin-up channel. 
   The script writes both the Hamiltonian and a fully polarized trial wavefunction to ``afqmc.h5``.

3. **Run SAFIRE**: Execute SAFIRE using the provided ``afqmc.json`` input file:

   First, go to the `inputs` directory, then run SAFIRE with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mpirun -n 64 safire afqmc.json

   SAFIRE will use fully polarized walkers, which is computationally efficient for systems with only one spin 
   channel containing all electrons.

4. **analyze the results**: Use the `scalar_stats` command-line tool from afqmctools to analyze the energy output:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ scalar_stats qmc.s000.scalar.dat -s time -e 5.0 -t --savefig energy_vs_beta.png

      ====== [analyze_scalar_data Settings] ======

      [+] fname            = qmc.s000.scalar.dat
      [+] mark_header      = #               
      [+] series_column    = time            
      [+] nequil           = 5.0             
      [+] estimate_equil   = False           
      [+] column           = LocalEnergy

      [+] append           = None            
      [+] dump             = False           
      [+] dump_fname       = trace.dat       
      [+] verbose          = True            
      [+] autocorr         = None            
      [+] savefig          = energy_vs_beta.png
      [+] dump_avail_columns = False           

      AFQMC Energy   -942.901682 +/-   0.000151 32.25  5.0/35.0

   This will compute the average AFQMC energy and stochastic uncertainty, using an equilibration time of 5.0 Ha^{-1}.
   The `-t` flag will generate a plot of the energy as a function of imaginary time if running locally.
   If running remotely, you can save the plot of the energy vs imaginary time to a file using the `--savefig [name].png` option.
   In either case, you should see the following output if you used the same settings as in the provided `afqmc.json` file and
   above.

5. compare with the reference CASCI energy: The AFQMC energy, -942.9017(2) Ha, agrees with the CASCI energy, -942.902141 Ha,
   which is the exact energy within the active space, to well within chemical accuracy.
    
See ``run.sh`` for execution details. The ``dice/`` directory contains an alternative trial wavefunction generation approach using selected CI.
