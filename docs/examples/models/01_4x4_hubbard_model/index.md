# 4x4 Square Lattice Hubbard Model

Author: Kyle Eskridge

In this tutorial, we will perform AFQMC calculations for the Hubbard model on
a 4x4 lattice.
The Hamiltonian is given by,
$$
\hat{H} = -t \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} \hat{c}^\dagger_i \hat{c}_j + U \sum_{i} \hat{n}^{\uparrow}_i \hat{n}^{\downarrow}_i,
$$
where $i,j$ are lattice site indices, angle brackets indicate nearest-neighbors,
$\hat{c}^\dagger_i$/$\hat{c}_i$ are electronic creation/annihilation operators,
and $\hat{n}^{\sigma}_i$ are spin-resolved number operators corresponding to site $i$.
The 4x4 lattice is small enough to make exact diagonalization possible.
We will use exact results for this system as reference data throughout
this tutorial.

The tutorial is structured as follows.
We will begin with an explanation of how to build lattice model Hamiltonians
using the `afqmctools` Python package.
Next, we will walk through computing the ground state energy of this Hamiltonian for a particular filling and value of U,
comparing a couple of options for trial wavefunctions.
Next, we will continue the walk through by computing the ground state charge,
and spin density for the same filling and value of U.
Next, we will demonstrated how to obtain exact results using AFQMC
for the special case of half filling for which, if care is taken,
there is no sign problem.

## Building a lattice model Hamiltonian

`afqmctools` provides a convenience lattice model Hamiltonian builder and writer which
will allow us to construct the "standard" Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site U, among
other Hamiltonians.
The basic steps for using the lattice model Hamiltonian builder are:
1. define lattice parameters
2. define Hamiltonian parameters
3. build the lattice model Hamiltonian

Step 3. can optionally be broken into two sub-steps:  

- construct the lattice instance using the lattice parameters
- construct the Hamiltonian using the lattice instance, and the Hamiltonian parameters

Breaking step 3. into substeps gives us easy access to the lattice instance
which will facilitate visualizing the charge and spin densities latter on,
so we will use this approach.

We now have a "standard" Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping and onsite U saved in an HDF5 file, "afqmc.h5"
which can be directly read by SAFIRE.
Next, we'll walk through an AFQMC calculation where we'll compute the ground state energy.

+++ {"id": "9KnqEEIS5xcn"}

## AFQMC Walkthrough : ground state energy

Here, we will compute the ground state energy of the "standard" Hubbard model
based on the Hamiltonian that we made previously - i.e.
$$
\hat{H} = -t \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} \hat{c}^\dagger_i \hat{c}_j + U \sum_{i} \hat{n}^{\uparrow}_i \hat{n}^{\downarrow}_i,
$$
with $t = 1.0$, and $U = 4.0$.
We will perform the calculation at half-filling.

AFQMC uses a trial wavefunction to control the sign problem at the cost of introducing a bias;
however, the bias can be minimized by using a trial wavefunction which accurately captures
the physics of the target system.
It is, therefore, important to check that candidate trial wavefunctions have the correct ordering,
symmetries, etc. before running an AFQMC calculation.
In addition to this, some methods for computing a trial wavefunction will lead to better results than
others for specific problems.
For example, both free-electron trial wavefunctions and Hartree-Fock (HF) trial wavefunctions
are reasonable for low-, to intermediate-U values.
Assuming that all candidate trial wavefunctions have the desired properties,
it may be necessary to test which wavefunction is better by running afqmc with each,
and comparing the results.
In this walk through, we will compare free-electron trial wavefunctions
to unrestricted Hartree-Fock trial wavefunctions.

### Free-electron Trial Wavefunction

`afqmctools` provides a convenience function, `free_electron()` ,for calculating free-electron trial wavefunctions.
Internally, `free_electron()` applies a small twist in order to break k-space degeneracy for open-shell systems.
It also accepts a user-supplied twist angle to used instead.
`free_electron()` will print the actual twist used in units of radians as, for example,

```
Generating free-electron trial wavefunction with twist = [4.10803005e-06 4.58334805e-04]
```


We note that, because of the twist angle, the Hamiltonian will typically need to be rebuilt.
All of this is done internally if `free_electron()` is given the original lattice, and hamiltonian parameters
as shown below.

... do we want to have a diagram here of k-space, and the expected one-body

wfn,spin_symm,autohf_results = free_electron(
    source=input_params,
    nelec=nelec,
    twist=None,                          # (optional) using the default small twist
    return_autohf = True,
    filling_strategy="balanced"

    walker_type=spin_symm,

    norb=lattice.N_sites
)
```

+++ {"id": "-xW_O9f35xco"}

Now that we have computed a free-electron wavefunction, we can inspect the results to validate it.
Internally, `free_electron()` uses the `autohf` HF solver in order to evaluate the energy of the free-electron trial wavefunction
for the interacting Hamiltonian.
In this case, for $N_{\uparrow} = N_{\downarrow} = 8$, we see that the total energy is
Etotal = Etotal=-5.18522319306247 $t$ with a one-body contribution of EK = -22.69026695983466 $t$,
and a Hubbard U contribution of EU=17.50504376677219.

Next, let's take a look at the charge and spin densities of the trial wavefunction.

)
```

+++ {"id": "R9Br4_CK5xco"}

As expected for a free-electron trial wavefunction with an even number of electrons,
the charge- and spin-densities are uniform.
For the charge-density, we see that the uniform charge density is 1.0 electron/site,
consistent with half-filling.
For the spin-density, we see that the uniform spin density is 0.0 spin/site,
which is expected for an even number of up and down electrons.

Next, we will run an AFQMC calculation.
SAFIRE uses an input file in json format to define AFQMC run parameters.

+++ {"id": "LRmDOsA-S8og"}

The Hubbard model at half-filling is sign-free, so we would expect numerically exact results; For U/t =4, the exact energy is -13.62185, so why do we disagree?

Even if the underlying Hamiltonian is sign-free (i.e. $\langle \Psi_\mathrm{T}|\Phi\rangle \ge 0$ for all walkers $|\Phi\rangle$), in the importance sampled AFQMC random walk, an improperly chosen trial wavefunction can still induce a bias if its nodes $\langle \Psi_\mathrm{T}|\Phi\rangle = 0$ do not coincide with those of the ground state. Especially free-electron trial wavefunctions in open-shell geometries are susceptible to this problem.

There are different approaches to dealing with this problem. One can either

1. move the nodes to the right position by choosing a trial wavefunction with the correct symmetry properties such as particle-hole symmetry or
2. allow the walkers to move around the nodes ergodically by using a noncollinear wavefunction that is not aligned with the spin axis of the Hubbard-Stratonovich decoupling.

Next, we will use a noncollinear Hartree-Fock trial wavefunction.

### Hartree-Fock Trial Wavefunction

Again, we expect to achieve very close to the exact energy for the Hubbard model at half filling which is -13.62185 for U/t=4.
We see much better agreement now than we did with the free-electron trial wavefunction before; however, we're still off by about 0.007 t, or about twice
the stochastic uncertainty of our result. Why do we not quite agree?

We have residual systematic errors to remove. Specifically, we will want
to remove the trotter error.
We can achieve this either by using a very small step size, or by extrapolating to $\tau = 0$.

Let's rerun with a smaller $\tau = 0.005$

## Computing Observables with Back-Propagation

General second-quantized observables can be computed using AFQMC via the back-propagation algorithm.
See the [SAFIRE documentation](https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~beskridge/safire/user_manual/estimators.html#back-propagation-bp-estimators) for more information on Back-propagated observables.
To "turn on" back-propagation, add an `"estimator"` block with `"name": "back_propagation"` to an `"execute"`
block in the input file.
Here is a sample input file where an ellipsis has been used to hide the rest of the input.

```json
{
  "afqmc": {
    
    /* ... */
      
    "execute": {

      /* ... */

      "population_control_interval" : 10,

      /* ... */

      "estimator": {
        "name": "back_propagation",
        "path_restoration": true,
        "extra_path_restoration": true,
        "bp_walker_ortho_interval": 5,
        "measure_interval_multipliers": [10,15,20],
        "equil_multiplier": 50,
        "onerdm": {
            "name": "one_rdm"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For back-propagation (BP), we will need to provide a BP time interval.
We will need to check for convergence in this parameter.
Notice that, just like the default estimator which measures and prints the energy, the number of steps is determined indirectly using the "measure_interval_multiplier" parameter;
however, unlike the default estimator, the BP estimator accepts multiple integr values for "measure_interval_multiplier" as shown in the example above.
In this case, BP will be run with each of the BP lengths provided and saved in an output HDF5 file separately.
This simplifies checking for convergence in the BP length by allowing us to re-use the "forward" propagation run for each BP length.

### Analyze the AFQMC output

The AFQMC code saves "scalar" data, such at the energy, in a file called `qmc.s000.scalar.dat` (a text file)
and non-scalar data, such as the one-rdm and other observables, in a file called `qmc.s000.stat.h5` (HDF5 file).
The AFQMC code includes tools to analyze both.
We have already analyzed the energy in the `qmc.s000.scalar.dat` file using `analyze_scalar_data()`.
We will now focus on analyzing observables saved in the HDF5 output file, `qmc.s000.stat.h5`.

## Average Observables

afqmctools provides tools to directly average observables from the HDF5 output
in the `afqmctools.analysis.average` module.
At the core of the module is the `average_observable()` function which extracts samples of a user specified observable from the HDF5 output file, and averages the samples while accounting for autocorrelation automatically.
Additionally, it users may provide one or more "transform" functions which are applied to the data samples immediately after reading from HDF5.
afqmctools provides a few transform function "factories"for generating common transforms.
We will use the `hermitize_factory()` to hermitize the one-rdm samples since SAFIRE measures only the upper-triangular part of the one-rdm.

In the code block below, we will plot the diagonal of the one-rdm for each BP average (i.e. for each BP length) in order to check for convergence in BP length.

## Visualizing Observables on the Lattice

We used the `afqmctools.utils.visualize` module's `plot_lattice()` function earlier in order to visualize the lattice itself.
The same function allows us to colorize each lattice site based on some observables.
Below, we plot the charge density, then the spin density on the lattice.
