Hubbard-Stratonovich Transformation Type Override
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING: This functionality is for experts only. Use at your own risk.

This example covers an advanced feature where we force a specific Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation (HST) type.
By default, the Hamiltonian builder will choose an appropriate HST type based on the sign 
of the interaction.
For band-dependent interactions, it will split each interaction into two separate terms if 
there are both positive and negative interaction strengths and assign an HST type separately.
The builder supports forcing a specific HST type; however, it will be applied to the specified 
interaction term regardless of the sign of the interaction strength.

afqmctools can be invoked within a Python script as

.. code-block:: python

    from afqmctools.wavefunction.free_electron import free_electron

    infile = "input.toml"

    # Build and save a lattice model Hamiltonian
    hamiltonian = HamiltonianDirector(source=infile).build()
    input_params = io.read_input_params(infile)
    nelec = input_params["misc_params"]["nelec"]
    io.write_model_hamiltion(
        hamiltonian=hamiltonian,
        fname="afqmc.h5",
        nelec=nelec
    )

    # compute and save a free-electron trial wfn
    free_electron(
        source=infile,
        nelec=nelec,
        output="afqmc.h5"
    )

If the sample Python script is run above with the sample input file, the following
should be present at the end of the output.

Internally, the AutoHF Hartree-Fock code is used to evaluate the energy of the free-electron
trial wavefunction with respect to the interacting Hamiltonian.
This allows the initial energy to be checked within the AFQMC code.
