02 Three-Band Hubbard Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example covers building a three-band Hubbard model Hamiltonian on a square Lattice, 
and generating a free-electron trial wavefunction.

A lattice model Hamiltonian can be generated using afqmctools and
a toml-based input file.
Below is a sample input file, which we name `input.toml`, for a Hubbard model 
on a 3x2 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions.

.. literalinclude:: input.toml

afqmctools can be invoked within a Python script as

.. code-block:: python

    from afqmctools.hamiltonian.model.director import HamiltonianDirector
    import afqmctools.utils.io as io
    from afqmctools.wavefunction.free_electron import free_electron

    infile = "input.toml"

    # Build and save a lattice model Hamiltonian
    hamiltonian = HamiltonianDirector(infile).build()
    nelec = io.read_input_params(infile)["misc_params"]["nelec"]
    io.write_model_hamiltion(
        hamiltonian=hamiltonian,
        fname="afqmc.h5",
        nelec=nelec
    )

    # compute and save a free-electron trial wfn
    free_electron(
        source=infile,
        nelec=nelec,
        output="afqmc.h5"
    )

The `free_electron()` function accepts a `twist` keyword argument for the sake of 
reproducibility for open-shell systems. 
`twist` should be a 2-d iterable containing :math:`\vec{\theta}=(\theta_1,\theta_2)`
in radians even if one component is set to 0.0.
By default, a small incomensurate twist angle is used.

If the sample Pyhton script is run above with the sample input file, the following
should be present at the end of the output.

.. code-block:: text

    energyCall: Etotal=(-15.473198890686035+0j) with EK=(-16+0j) EU=(0.5268006920814514+0j) EU1=0 EU2=0 EJ=0
    Reference HF Energy = -15.473198890686035



Internally, the AutoHF Hartree-Fock code is used to evaluate the energy of the free-electron
trial wavefunction with respect to the interacting Hamiltonian.
This allows the initial energy to be checked within the AFQMC code.

See the examples in :ref:`run_afqmc_exs` for how to run AFQMC.
