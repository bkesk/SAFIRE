03 Generating a JSON input file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SAFIRE uses an input file in .json format to set parameters 
in calculations.
This example covers generating a .json input file for AFQMC.
It assumes that you already have an HDF5 file containing 
a Hamiltonian and trial wavefunction.
If not, see the examples in :ref:`setup_exs`.

For demonstration, it is assumed that a Hamiltonian exists in an HDF5 file called `afqmc_ham.h5` and 
a trial wavefunction is saved in an HDF5 file called `afqmc_wfn.h5`.
Of course, the Hamiltonian and wavefunction can exist within the same HDF5 file if desired.

The input file is explained in detail in :ref:`input_afqmc`.
We can use the `afqmctools` Python module to generate one for us
using the same keywords as in the input file.
In the example below, we show how to set the "execute" block parameters
with all possible options explicitly enumerated with the exception
of the "estimator" block(s).
Each type of "estimator" block has it's own set of possible arguments.

.. literalinclude:: example.py

Note that all intervals are expressed in units of "steps".
Running the example Python script above will generate a file called `afqmc.json` with the following content:

.. literalinclude:: afqmc.json

See :ref:`run_afqmc_ex_1` for an example of running AFQMC given an input file.
