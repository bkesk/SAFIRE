Walkthroughs
============

Step-by-step walkthroughs that carry you from start to finish through a complete process. 
These show how multiple features fit together in real-world scenarios, 
making them useful for understanding context and best practices.
The walkthroughs are organized based on their application domain.

Quantum Chemistry / Molecules

Ab initio solids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use Quantum Espresso to perform
DFT calculations, and Coquí to generate a Hamiltonian and write trial wavefunctions.
