.. _input_afqmc:

Input file
==========

The AFQMC executable runs AFQMC calculations based on the settings provided in an
input file written in json.
The input file is described in detail below.
This reference document assumes familiarity with the AFQMC method.
An explanation of the AFQMC method is provided elsewhere in the :ref:`AFQMC overview <afqmc>`.
The structure of the input file is described below in  :ref:`input_file_strcuture`.

.. seealso::

   The :ref:`SAFIRE tutorials <tutorials>` covers the input file along with other relevant topics.

.. _input_file_strcuture:

Input File Structure
--------------------

The input file is json format and consists of several json "blocks".
Some input blocks may have sub-blocks as described below.
The highest level block determines what kind of calculation to run.
Currently, "afqmc" is the only supported option.

.. important::

  The wavefunction, hamiltonian, and walker_set blocks may be defined either within an execute block or outside of an execute block.
  If defined outside of an execute block, they must be given a name via the "name" parameter.
  They can then be referenced by name within an execute block.

Below is a sample input file for an AFQMC calculation in SAFIRE. 
We will explore the details of this input file in the following sections.

   * - **series**
     - 0
     - An up to 3-digit integer which may be used to identify the specific calculation that is being performed. AFQMC output files are prefixed by "id" and "series" (below) ``[id].[series].*``

Externally defined blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The wavefunction, hamiltonian, and walker_set blocks may be defined either within an execute block or outside of an execute block.
If defined outside of an execute block, they must be given a name via the "name" parameter.
They can then be referenced by name within an execute block instead of defining a json block.
For example, in the input file below, the walker_set is defined outside of the execute block and given the name "my_walkers".

.. code-block:: json
  :caption: Sample input file for AFQMC with Externally Defined Blocks

  {
    "afqmc": {
      "walker_set": {
          "name" : "my_walker_set"
      },
      "execute": {
        "walker_set" : "my_walker_set",
        "wavefunction": {
          /* ... */
        },
        "hamiltonian": {
          /* ... */
        },
        "timestep": 0.01,
        "steps": 10000,
        "population_control_interval" : 10,
        "measure_interval_multiplier": 1,
        "walker_ortho_interval": 10,
        "n_walkers_per_mpi_task": 10,
        "seed" : 42,
        "estimator": {
          /* ... */
        },
        "estimator": {
          /* ... */
        }
      }
    }
  }

.. note::

  Externally defined blocks can be reused in multiple execute blocks.
  The underlying objects have a persistent state between execute blocks.
  This allows a walker population to be reused across different simulation runs,
  picking up where the last projection left off.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 15 55

   * - **Parameter**
     - **Default**
     - **Description**
   * - **timestep**
     - 
     - The Trotter step size, :math:`\tau`, in inverse energy units. The specific unit depends on what units are used to represent the Hamiltonian such that :math:`\tau \hat{H}` is dimensionless.
   * - **steps**
     - 
     - The total number of projection steps, :math:`N_{steps}` to perform. Together, the "steps" setting and the "timestep" setting determine the total projection time :math:`\beta = N_{steps} \tau`
   * - **population_control_interval**
     - 10
     - The number of projection steps between population control operations. Population control is relatively inexpensive, and it is typically okay to allow this interval to remain small.
   * - **measure_interval_multiplier**
     - 1
     - Used to determine the number of projection steps between measurements using the formula below. Measurement is the most expensive operation in AFQMC. A larger "measure_interval_multiplier" will reduce the CPU time necessary to perform AFQMC calculations.
   * - **walker_ortho_interval**
     - 10
     - The number of projection steps between application of the modified Gram-Schmidt (mGS) orthogonalization procedure. The mGS procedure is relatively inexpensive computationally and frequent orthogonalization is recommended.
   * - **n_walkers_per_mpi_task**
     - 10
     - The number of random walkers to use per MPI task. This value should be chosen such that the total population is reasonably large. The choice also depends on whether SAFIRE has been compiled for CPUs or GPUs. For GPUs, the goal is to saturate the device memory and could be on the order of 10000 for small systems. For CPUs and many MPI tasks, this value will typically be on the order of 10.
   * - **seed**
     - 
     - The seed for the random number generator. This value only needs to be set when strict reproducibility is necessary.

.. important::

  The measure_interval is specified indirectly using the measure_interval_multiplier parameter. 
  It is computed using the population_control_interval according to the formula

  .. math::

    measure\_interval = measure\_interval\_multiplier \times population\_control\_interval

.. caution::

  Take care to update `measure_interval_multiplier` if you change `population_control_interval`

.. _wavefunction_block:

Wavefunction block
------------------

The wavefunction block contains settings related to the trial wavefunction used in the AFQMC code.
**It is one of the only mandatory sub-blocks within the "execute" block.**
The wavefunction block must at least specify an HDF5 file containing the trial wavefunction.
Some settings are relevant only to specific classes of trial wavefunctions as indicated in the settings
listings below.
