# Computing general observables

<b>Goal:</b>
Become acquainted with how to compute general observables with SAFIRE.




## What you will learn



1. What an "estimator" is and how to set one up in the json input file
2. What a mixed estimator is and when to use one to compute an observable
3. What a back-propagated estimator is and when to use one to compute an observable
4. How to compute observables in post-processing with afqmctools




## Introduction


SAFIRE uses "estimators" to compute observables.
Each estimator corresponds to a formal method for computing an observable - i.e. mixed estimators, back-propagated estimators, etc. - We will explain each of the these in the next section.
As we mentioned in the


[understanding the Input file tutorial</font>](../02_understanding_the_input_file/02_understanding_the_input_file.html),


you can add estimators to an AFQMC calculation using an "estimator" input block.
By default, an "energy" estimator is included which is a specialized mixed estimator.
Other estimators allow you to specify one or more additional observables to compute.




## Formal Background

Although we have not seen this explicitly, we have, so far, computed the ground state energy with AFQMC using a so-called
mixed estimator of the form

$$
\langle \hat{O} \rangle_{Mixed} = \frac{1}{\sum_k W_{n,k}} \sum_k W_{n,k} \frac{\langle \Psi_T | \hat{O} | \Phi_{n,k} \rangle }{\langle \Psi_T | \Phi_{n,k} \rangle}
$$

where $n$ is the projection step index,
$| \Phi_{n,k} \rangle$ are Slater determinant random walkers with weight $W_{n,k}$ (from importance sampling),
and $| \Psi_T \rangle$ is the trial wavefunction.
The mixed estimator provides an unbiased estimate for any observable which commutes with the Hamiltonian.
For the AFQMC energy, $\hat{O} = \hat{H}$, and trivially $[ \hat{O}, \hat{H} ] = 0$;
therefore, the mixed estimator is an unbiased choice for the total ground state energy.

On the other hand, it is often interesting to compute observables which do not commute with the Hamiltonian.
For example, the one-body reduced density matrix, from which many properties can be computed, does not commute
with the Hamiltonian.
In these cases, a back-propagated estimator is necessary to mitigate the bias that would be incurred
by using a mixed-estimator.
The back-propagated estimator has the form,
$$
\langle \hat{O} \rangle_{BP} = \frac{1}{\sum_k W_{n+m,k}} \sum_k W_{n+m,k} \frac{\langle \tilde{\Phi}_{m,k} | \hat{O} | \Phi_{n,k} \rangle }{\langle \tilde{\Phi}_{m,k} |\Phi_{n,k}\rangle}
$$

where $| \Phi_{n,k} \rangle$ are the usual forward-projected Slater determinant random walkers,
and $| \tilde{\Phi}_{m,k} \rangle$ are the back-propgated walkers given by,
$$
| \tilde{\Phi}_{m,k} \rangle = \hat{B}^\dagger( (x - \bar{x})_{n,k} ) ... \hat{B}^\dagger( (x - \bar{x})_{n+m-1,k} ) | \Psi_T \rangle
$$.
The index $n$ corresponds to the current forward projection step,
and $m$ is the back-propagated step index.
We note that each random walker has a corresponding back-propagated partner
which share the same path in auxiliary-field space.
It is important to note that the two Slater determinants are
distinct from each other since the propagator $B(x - \bar{x})$ is applied differently to each.
i.e. the propagator is applied to different Slater determinants when moving in the forward-, and backward-directions.

## Setup the Test System

We will again use Si in its primtive cell at equilibrium represent in a basis of Kohn-Sham bands as a toy case to run
concrete calculations on.

The trial wavefunction is also derived from the DFT solution.
We have provided HDF5 files containing the Hamiltonian and trial wavefunctions, respectively.

## The "Energy" Estimator

By default, SAFIRE will include an "energy estimator" in the calculation.
This is formally a mixed estimator where $\hat{O} = \hat{H}$.
The Hamiltonian trivially commutes with itself, so a mixed estimator of the energy is unbiased.

You can add an energy estimator input block to your json input file in order to customize its settings.
For example, in the input block,

```json
"estimator" : {
  "name" : "energy",
  "print_components" : True,        
  "overwrite" : True
}
```

the "name" keyword tells us what kind of estimator we want.
In this case, we want an "energy" estimator.
We are setting the "print_components" and "overwrite" flags to true.
"print_components" tells SAFIRE to print the one-body, two-body direct, and two-body exchange contributions to the energy separately.
"overwrite" tells SAFIRE to overwrite the default energy estimator
with the one that we have defined.



### Most Common Settings

## Extracting and Analyzing the AFQMC energy.

We learned about basic energy analysis using the CLI and the `analyze_scalar_data()` Python function in the [Hello SAFIRE](../01_hello_afqmc_solids/01_hello_afqmc_solids.html) tutorial.
We can use the same tools here to get the average AFQMC energy and the stochastic uncertainty.

For pedagogical reasons, we will instead read the entire scalar data file so that we can plot several of the data columns as a function of total projection time.
In the code block below, the total energy (solid blue line) is plotted along with the sum of the three individual columns (dotted orange line) corresponding to the one-body energy, the direct / Coulomb interaction energy, and the exchange energy.
The two curves agree with each other to machine precision.

Run the code block below.

## Computing Observables using a "Mixed" Estimator

SAFIRE also includes a mixed estimator that periodically evaluates,

$$
\langle \hat{O} ⟩_{Mixed} = \frac{1}{\sum_k W_{n,k}} \sum_k W_{n,k} \frac{\langle \Psi_T | \hat{O} | \Phi_{n,k} \rangle }{\langle \Psi_T | \Phi_{n,k} \rangle},
$$
where $\hat{O}$ is an operator.
The one-body reduced density matrix (1rdm), given by

$$\hat{O} = \hat{\rho}^1 = \sum_{ij}\sum_{\sigma \sigma'} \hat{c}^\dagger_{i \sigma}\hat{c}_{j \sigma'},$$

and the two-body reduced density matrix (2rdm), given by,

$$\hat{O} = \hat{\rho}^2 = \sum_{ijkl}\sum_{\sigma \sigma'}\hat{c}^\dagger_{i\sigma}\hat{c}^\dagger_{j\sigma'}\hat{c}_{k\sigma'}\hat{c}_{l\sigma}$$

are common observables.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
<b>Note:</b>
    computing the 2rdm is very time and memory intensive; this should only be done for small systems.
</div>

### Specifying Observables to Measure

You can specify which observables you want to compute by
adding a corresponding observable block to an estimator
block.
For example, the estimator block below includes both the 1rdm, and the diagonal 2rdm.

```json
"estimator" : {
    "name" : "mixed",
    "onerdm" : {
        "name" : "my_onerdm"
    },
    "diag2rdm" : {
        "name" : "my_diag2rdm"
    }
}
```

As we will see later, this is exactly how observables are specified for the BP estimator as well.
See the [User Manual](https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~beskridge/safire/user_manual/observables.html#observables) for a complete list of currently implemented observables.

### Pedagogical Demonstration

Below, we will use a mixed estimator to compute the 1-rdm, and the diagonal 2-rdm.
We can then directly compute each contribution to the AFQMC energy,

$$E_{one-body} = \sum_{ij} \sum_{\sigma, \sigma'} H^1_{ij} \rho^1_{j\sigma', i\sigma} $$

$$E_{two-body} = \sum_{ijkl} H^2_{ijkl} \rho^2_{ijkl} $$

and compare with the results from the energy estimator.
**We should find exact agreement between the two if we use the same AFQMC run parameters.**

Run the code below to write the input file!

Now, we can run AFQMC with a Mixed Estimator in order to compute the 1-rdm.
**This will probably take a while!** To finish the tutorial more quickly, remove the "twordm" block from the input and just compate the one-body energy.

### Data Extraction and Analysis

afqmctools provides several tools for extracting data - i.e. retrieving data from the SAFIRE output files - and analyzing data - ariving at a final average with stochastic uncertainty.

Since some observables require a large amount of memory to store, `afqmctools` also provides "transforms" which are applied to the raw observables as they are read from disk.
For example, in the cell below, a enery evaluation transform is used to compute the one-body energy, a scalar, on the fly as one-rdm samples are read from the *.h5 data file.
This dramatically reduces the memory needed to analyze the AFQMC results from SAFIRE.

As we can see, the energy computed using the one-body reduced density matrix with a mixed estimator yeilds the exact same one-body energies as the energy estimator to very high precision.
This is no surprise since the energy estimator is simply a specialized mixed estimator.


### Your Turn : Extract the 2rdm and compute the 2-body energy

Repeat the same excercise for the two-body energy.
As we saw in the energy estimator section, the exchange and direct coulomb energies are printed to file separately by the energy estimator.

To compute the two-body energy, you will need to measure the "diag_twordm" observable during AFQMC, and extract and transform it.

We provide code for setting up the appropriate transform functions in the code block below.

Note that the diagonal 2-rdm is stored as the upper-triangular of the full matrix.

Once again, we see that the two body energy computed from the two-body reduced density matrix samples is the same as the two body energy from the energy estimator (after adding the exchange and direct Coulomb contributions together, of course).

## Averaging Observables

Averaging observables computed using AFQMC requires some care.

First, one must make sure that the data is equilibrated.

Second, in AFQMC, successive samples are not independent since they depend on the recent history of each walker.
This is known as "autocorrelation".
Care must be take to remove autocorrelation effects or the stochastic uncertainty will be underestimated.

The former can be achieved by visualizing the observable over imaginary time, and finding the equilibration time by inspection.
We saw this in the [Hello SAFIRE](../01_hello_afqmc_solids/01_hello_afqmc_solids.html) tutorial.
afqmctools provides tools for automatically computing the auto-correlation time - i.e. the time interval at which measurments are no longer autocorrelated - and adjusting the number of effective samples accordingly.

In the code cell below, we demonstrate how to use the provided tools to automatically compute averages.

## Back-Propagation (BP) in SAFIRE

Mixed estimators are biased for observables $\hat{O}$ such that $[\hat{O},\hat{H}] \neq 0$, which requires the use of pure estimators. The Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm is used to compute pure estimators efficiently in SAFIRE.

### Basic BP Configuration

BP is invoked in SAFIRE by including a "back_propagation" estimator in the input file:

```json
{
  "estimator": {
    "name": "back_propagation",
    "path_restoration": true,
    "bp_walker_ortho_interval": 5,
    "measure_interval_multiplier": 20,
    "equil_multiplier": 100,
    "onerdm": {
      "name": "one_rdm"
    }
  }
}
```

Observables are added to the BP block in the same way as for mixed estimators.

### Measurement Intervals

Since BP involves an additional projection, the measurement interval controls the number of back-propagated steps.
Just as in the execute block or a mixed estimator block, the input file includes a measurement interval "multiplier", and the actual measurement interval, $m$, is determined as:

$$
m = (\textrm{measure_interval_multiplier}) \times (\textrm{population_control_interval})
$$

### Multiple BP Lengths

SAFIRE implements the capability of running BP with multiple BP measurement lengths.
We call each measurement with a different BP length an "average".
This allows the forward projection to be reused while checking for convergence in the BP length.
To define multiple BP lengths/averages, simply provide a JSON array for measure_interval_multiplier corresponding to all of the BP lengths that you would like to use:

```json
{
  "estimator": {
    "name": "back_propagation",
    "path_restoration": true,
    "bp_walker_ortho_interval": 10,
    "measure_interval_multiplier": [60, 70, 80],
    "equil_multiplier": 80,
    "onerdm": {
      "name": "one_rdm"
    }
  }
}
```

### Equilibration Phase

The BP estimator implements an equilibration phase at the beginning of the AFQMC calculation where no BP is performed.
This is recommended since computing observables is expensive and since AFQMC needs to equilibrate before samples can meaningfully contribute to the average.
Similarly to the measure_interval_multiplier, the equilibration time is specified as an equilibration multiplier (`"equil_multiplier"`) and the actual equilibration time is given by:

$$\text{equil_time} = (\text{equil_multiplier}) \times (\text{population_control_interval})$$

### Demonstraiton of BP

For the sake of execution time, we will compute only the one-rdm using the back-propagation estimator.
We will find that the one-body energy computed using the BP one-rdm will *not* agree with the one computed using a mixed estimator.
The BP-estimated one-body energy is unbiased, and represents a better estimate of the one-body energy than that provided by the mixed estimator.

### Key Takeaways from Back-Propagation Analysis

**When to Use BP vs Mixed Estimators:**

1. **Mixed Estimators**: Use for observables that commute with the Hamiltonian (like energy). They are computationally cheaper and provide unbiased estimates.

2. **Back-Propagation**: Required for observables that do not commute with the Hamiltonian (like the one-body reduced density matrix). BP provides pure estimators that are unbiased.

**Important BP Configuration Points:**

- **Equilibration**: Always include an equilibration phase (`equil_multiplier`) to allow AFQMC to reach equilibrium before BP measurements begin.

- **Multiple BP Lengths**: Use multiple BP lengths to check convergence. Longer BP lengths generally provide more accurate results but are more expensive.

- **Computational Cost**: BP calculations are significantly more expensive than mixed estimators due to the additional back-propagation steps.

**Convergence Analysis:**

The plots above show how the BP estimator converges with increasing BP length. For observables that don't commute with the Hamiltonian, you should see:
- Different results between mixed and BP estimators (showing the bias in mixed estimators)
- Convergence of BP results as the BP length increases
- Eventually, BP results should converge to the true value

This demonstrates why BP is essential for computing unbiased estimates of observables like charge densities, spin densities, and other quantities derived from the one-body reduced density matrix.
