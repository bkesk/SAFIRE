# Writing a Hamiltonian File

<b>Goal:</b>
Become acquainted with how to write a Hamiltonian to the SAFIRE HDF5 format.

## What you will learn

1.  How to write a Hamiltonian to the SAFIRE HDF5 format starting from one-body, and two-body integrals
2.  How to convert from a FCIDUMP file to the SAFIRE HDF5 format both using the CLI tools and within a Python script
3.  (For convenience) How to use PySCF and afqmctools to generate and write the Hamiltonian

## Introduction

In previous tutorials, we learned how to run SAFRIE, and how
to post process the results to arrive at the AFQMC energy.
Now, we will learn how to write a Hamiltonian in SAFRIE's HDF5 format.

##  Setting up

As we have seen in previous tutorials, the SAFIRE executable is implemented for generic second quantized Hamiltonians, and wavefunctions.
Before we can run an AFQMC calculation, we must generate:

1. A Hamiltonian
2. A trial wavefunction
3. a json input file

Implicit in items 1. and 2. is the need for an orthonormal basis in
which to compute matrix elements of the Hamiltonian,
and to represent the trial wavefunction in terms of.

In this tutorial, we will use the set of canonical Hartree-Fock orbitals
from RHF as a basis.

+++ {"id": "RsbyXg-OyCNe"}

## The Hamiltonian

We are often interested in the electronic ground state of the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian which is given in first quantization
by
$$
H_\mathrm{Born-Oppenheimer} = \sum_p^{N_e}\left(  -\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2_p + \sum_A^{N_{A}} \frac{Z_A}{ | \vec{R}_A - \vec{r}_p | }  \right) + \frac{1}{2} \sum^{N_e}_{q \neq p} \left(\frac{1}{r_{pq}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{A' \neq A}^{N_A} \frac{Z_{A} Z_{A'}}{| R_A - R_{A'} |},
$$
where,
$N_e$ is the number of electrons,
$\vec{r}_p$ is the position of electron $p$,
$N_{A}$ is the number of atomic nuclei,
and $Z_A$ and $\vec{R}_A$ are the atomic number and position, respectively, of atomic nuclei, $A$.

AFQMC is formulated in terms of the second quantized Hamiltonian.
In second quantization, we express the Hamiltonian in terms of electronic creation/annihilation operators
, $\hat{c}^{\dagger}_i$ / $\hat{c}_i$, which create/annihilate an electron in the chosen basis set orbitals,
$\{ \phi_i (\vec{r})\}$.
The Hamiltonian takes the form,
$$
\hat{H} = H^0 + \sum_{ij} H^1_{ij} \hat{c}^{\dagger}_i\hat{c}_j + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j \neq i} H^2_{ijkl} \hat{c}^{\dagger}_i \hat{c}^{\dagger}_j \hat{c}_k \hat{c}_l
$$
where
$$
H^0 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{A' \neq A}^{N_A} \frac{Z_{A} Z_{A'}}{| R_A - R_{A'} |},
$$
is the constant nuclear repulsion energy,
$$
H^1_{ij} = \int d\vec{r}_p  \phi^*_i (\vec{r}_p) \left(  -\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2_p + \sum_A^{N_{atom}} \frac{Z_A}{ | \vec{R}_A - \vec{r}_p | }  \right) \phi_j (\vec{r}_p),
$$
contains the "one-body" kinetic term and electron-nuclei interactions,
and
$$
H^2_{ijkl} = (il|jk) = \frac{1}{2} \int \int d\vec{r}_p d\vec{r}_q  \left( \phi^*_i (\vec{r}_p)  \phi_l (\vec{r}_p)  \frac{1}{|\vec{r}_p - \vec{r}_q|}  \phi^*_j (\vec{r}_q) \phi_k (\vec{r}_q)  \right)
$$
is the electron-electron Coulomb interaction.

Typically, an external quantum chemistry code will be used to generate integrals.
For this tutorial, we will use the minimal basis Hydrogen dimer since it can be easily written down by hand.
See, for example, section 3.5.2 in ref. 1.

The code block below contains the Hamiltonian for the $H_2$ molecule at a
bondlength of $\delta_{H-H} = 1.4$ Bohr radii in a standard sto-3g basis.

### Save the Hamiltonian

`afqmctools` provides Python functions for writting Hamiltonians in an HDF5 file that can be read by the SAFIRE executable as
shown in the code block below.
AFQMC uses a factorized form of the electron-electron interaction tensor,

$$
 H^2_{ijkl} = \sum_\gamma L^{\gamma}_{il}L^{\gamma}_{jk}.
$$
Any decomposition of this form can be used in AFQMC.
Density fitting integrals, for example can be written in this form.
A typical strategy in the AFQMC literature is to perform a Cholesky decomposition of the super-matrix $H^2_{(i,l),(j,k)}$
using a Cholesky tolerance of $\delta_{Chol}$ where a smaller
value of $\delta_{Chol}$ produces a more accurate representation.

The Cholesky decomposition is automatically performed within `write_hamiltonian_generic()` if you
provide it with the electron Coulomb interaction tensor.
Alternatively, 3-index integrals (from density fitting, for example) can be provided to use
directly with no further modifications.

**Run the following codeblock to output the Hamiltonian to an HDF5 file**.

    H_one_body=H1_ij,
    coulomb_repuslion_tensor=H2_ijkl
)
```

## The Trial Wavefunction

We will explore how to write trial wavefunctions in {doc}`../04_writing_a_trial_wavefunction/04_writing_a_trial_wavefunction`.
In general, the trial wavefunction is a linear combination of Slater determinants,
$$
| \Psi_T \rangle = \sum^{N_{det}}_n C_n | \Phi_n \rangle,
$$
where $C_n$ is a cofficient,
and $|\Phi_n\rangle$ are Slater determinants which are not necessarily
orthogonal to each other.

**For now, simply run the next code block to save the RHF ground state
in the same HDF5 file as the Hamiltonian.**

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: Jn_ITkJiyCNf

import numpy as np

from afqmctools.wavefunction.mol import write_wfn
from afqmctools.inputs.from_hdf import write_json

# RHF orbtials represented in the basis of RHF orbitals
orbitals = np.array(
    [[1.0,0.0],
    [0.0,1.0]]
)

phi_0 = np.array([
    orbitals[:, :number_of_electrons[0]]
])
C_0 = 1.0

wfn = ( np.array([C_0]), phi_0)

write_wfn(
    filename=scratch_dir/ "wfn.h5",
    wfn=wfn,
    walker_type="rhf",
    nelec=number_of_electrons,
    norb=number_of_orbitals
)
write_json(scratch_dir / "afqmc.json", scratch_dir / "wfn.h5", scratch_dir / "hamil.h5")
```

+++ {"id": "CXQ3jT_pyCNf"}

## Your Turn: Compute the AFQMC energy

At this point, you should run an AFQMC calculation using SAFIRE
as we covered earlier in {doc}`../01_hello_safire/01_hello_safire`,
and use `afqmctools` to obtain the AFQMC energy.

As a reminder, you can run SAFIRE in any of the following ways:

1. the `run_afqmc()` convenience wrapper - we've included a template in the next code cell.
2. run from the command line as `$ mpirun -np [number of MPI tasks] qmcapp --filenames [input file].json`
3. (if you are running on a computing cluster) submit a job via a runscript.

As an additional reminder, the `analyze_scalar_data` tool can be invoked by either

1. calling it from the CLI as `$ scalar_stats [id].s[series].scalar.dat`
2. in a Python script / notebook with `analyze_scalar_data()` - we've also included a template in a code block below that you can use for this exercise.

    trace = True
)

_ = analyze_scalar_data(settings)
```

### Check your result

Your AFQMC energy should agree with $-1.137024 \pm 0.000195 E_{Hartree}$
to within 1-2 $\sigma$.

For comparison, the FCI energy is $-1.1372759436170439 E_{Hartree}$.

Our AFQMC result agrees FCI to within 0.0003(2) $E_{Hartree}$ which
is well within chemical accuracy.

## Starting from a FCIDUMP

`afqmctools` provides tools to convert from a Hamiltonian in a standard
FCIDUMP file to the format used by SAFIRE.

We will continue with the example of a Hydrogen dimer in an STO-3G basis to demonstrate the tooling.

<div>
<img src="https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~beskridge/tutorial_figs/6784ee4ea455921958ac327234b91ab07702736ab22fa2df804e8dccbc36a404/03_writing_a_Hamiltonian/HyrdogenMolecule.png" width="500">
</div>

Instructions for generating a FCIDUMP are beyond the scope of this tutorial;
however, quantum chemistry codes that can easily generate FCIDUMP files are ubiquitious.

For simplicity, we provide a FCIDUMP file which, starting from the GitHub repo root, can be found in,

```bash
    tutorial/molecules/03_writing_a_hamiltonian/files/H2_FCIDUMP
```

+++ {"id": "qYRe4bEt1xSN"}

## CLI: Covert from FCIDUMP to the SAFIRE format.

The `fcidump_to_afqmc` CLI script can be used to directly convert
from a FCIDUMP file to the HDF5 format used by SAFIRE.
If you follow the official installation instrcutions for `afqmctools`, then
`fcidump_to_afqmc` should already be installed.

It can be used as
```bash
  fcidump_to_afqmc -i H2_FCIDUMP  -t 1.0e-5 -o H2_Hamiltonian.h5
```
which reads the "input" (`-i`) Hamiltonian from `H2_FCIDUMP`,
performs a Cholesky decomposition with a tolerance (`-t`) of `1.e-5`,
and saves the Hamiltonian to the "output" (`-o`) HDF5 file, ` H2_Hamiltonian.h5`.

Additionally, you can use the `--help` option to see what other options are available.

**Your Turn: Run the next code block to run see the help message**

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: 7qfvZqBL14Vt

!fcidump_to_afqmc --help
```

+++ {"id": "pX0yckNd2j9A"}

### CLI: Also write a trial wavefunction

The next input that we will need for AFQMC is a trial wavefunction.
The `fcidump_to_afqmc` CLI script can also write either an RHF- or ROHF-like
trial wavefunction to the SAFIRE HDF5 file.

The wavefunction is a single Slater determinant in which the first $N_{\uparrow}$/$N_{\downarrow}$ *by index*
orbitals are occupied.
$N_{\uparrow}$ and $N_{\downarrow}$ are determined by the information in the header of the FCIDUMP file.
It is also possible to explicitly specify orbital occcupancies with the `--occ_up` and `--occ_down` swithces.

### Your Turn
Run the following codeblock to output the Wavefunction to an HDF5 file via the CLI.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: 8JgG5DbH24kR

# Use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to convert the Hamiltonian AND write a trial wavefunction
!fcidump_to_afqmc -i files/H2_FCIDUMP -o {scratch_dir}/H2.h5 --add_wfn --occ_up 0 --occ_down 0
```

+++ {"id": "7NLzntps2CS7"}

## Python: Covert from FCIDUMP to the SAFIRE format.

The `afmctools` Python package provides the following functions which allow us to convert form FCIDUMP to
the SAFIRE format.

- `read_fcidump()` in the `afqmctools.hamiltonian.converter` module
- `write_hamiltonian_generic()` in the `afqmctools.hamiltonian.mol` module

### read_fcidump()

The `read_fcidump()` function reads the Hamiltonian from the FCIDUMP file
with name `filename`, and separately returns the 1-body, 2-body, and constant Hamiltonian
terms as well as the number of electrons.

```python
    from afqmctools.hamiltonian.converter import read_fcidump

    H1_ij, H2_ijkl, E0, _ = read_fcidump(
        filename="H2_FCIDUMP"
    )
```

see the [API documentation for more](https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~beskridge/auxiliary_fields/api/afqmctools.hamiltonian.html#afqmctools.hamiltonian.converter.read_fcidump)

### write_hamiltonian_generic()

As we saw above, the `write_hamiltonian_generic()` funciton will generate an HDF5 file that can
be read by the SAFIRE executable containing the Hamiltonian.
It will automatically generate a Cholesky decomposed form of the interaction if if a electron-repulsion integrals are provded via the `coulomb_repuslion_tensor` keyword argument.
Alternativaly, any 3-index factorized form of the electron interaction can be provided
via the `cholesky_vectors` input parameter.
Exactly one of `cholesky_vectors` or `coulomb_repuslion_tensor` must be provided to
`write_hamiltonian_generic()`.

```python
    import numpy as np

    from afqmctools.hamiltonian.mol import write_hamiltonian_generic


    # transopose to match conventions for write_hamiltonian_generic
    H2_ijkl = numpy.transpose(H2_ijkl,(0,1,3,2))

    write_hamiltonian_generic(
        filename=scratch_dir/"H2_hamiltonian.h5",
        E0=H0,
        H_one_body=H1_ij,
        coulomb_repuslion_tensor=H2_ijkl,
        cholesky_delta=1.0e-5
    )
```

see the [API documentation for more](https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~beskridge/auxiliary_fields/api/afqmctools.hamiltonian.html#afqmctools.hamiltonian.mol.write_hamiltonian_generic).

### Your Turn: Run the following code block to convert from the provided FCIDUMP file to the SAFIRE format

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: 6ej77YPU2JmI

import numpy as np
from afqmctools.hamiltonian.mol import write_hamiltonian_generic
from afqmctools.hamiltonian.converter import read_fcidump

H1_ij, H2_ijkl, E0, _ = read_fcidump(
    filename="files/H2_FCIDUMP"
)

# transopose to match conventions for write_hamiltonian_generic
H2_ijkl = np.transpose(H2_ijkl,(0,1,3,2))

write_hamiltonian_generic(
    filename=scratch_dir/"H2_hamiltonian.h5",
    E0=E0,
    H_one_body=H1_ij,
    coulomb_repuslion_tensor=H2_ijkl,
    cholesky_delta=1.0e-5
)
```

+++ {"id": "jNDV-Ersu9ul"}

## Generate and write the Hamiltonian using PySCF and afqmctools

Instead of defining the Hamiltonian and the wavefunction from scratch, one can also utilize `PySCF` to obtain the Hamiltonian in a given basis (in this case, the molecular orbital basis) and the trial wavefunction.
Here, we use `PySCF` to run RHF for the hydrogen dimer and export to a chkfile `h2_rhf.h5`, then use `afqmctools` to obtain the Hamiltonian and the trial wavefunction from the chkfile.
After this, you may follow the same steps as above to run AFQMC.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: TMmTH-7SvFd8

from pyscf import gto, scf

# build the H2 dimer
xyz = "H 0. 0. 0.; H 0. 0. 1.4"
mol = gto.Mole(unit = "Bohr",
            atom = xyz,
            precision = 1e-6,
            basis = "sto-3g")

mol.build()

# run RHF
mf = scf.RHF(mol)
mf.chkfile = f"{scratch_dir}/h2_rhf.h5"
mf.kernel()

from afqmctools.utils.pyscf_utils import load_from_pyscf_chk_mol
from afqmctools.wavefunction.mol import write_wfn_mol
from afqmctools.hamiltonian.mol import write_hamil_mol

# reload the mf data
mf_data = load_from_pyscf_chk_mol(f"{scratch_dir}/h2_rhf.h5", 'scf')

# dump the Hamiltonian and the wavefunction to the same h5df
fout = f"{scratch_dir}/h2_from_pyscf.h5"
write_hamil_mol(
    mf_data,
    fout,
    chol_cut=1e-6,
    dense=True,
    real_chol=True,
    verbose=True
    )

write_wfn_mol(
    mf_data,
    fout,
    basis_scf_data=mf_data
)

## Summary

In this tutorial, you set up and ran a quantum chemistry AFQMC calculation in which we computed the ground state energy of the Hydrogen dimer at a fixed bondlength.

The AFQMC code needs a Hamiltonian, a trial wavefunction, and a file containing settings as input, and it outputs stochastic samples as specified in the input file.
